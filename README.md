## Overview

This project is to improve my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills for positioning design, accessibility and slider effects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

I put all contents in <main>, and centered within <body> by CSS-grid.
For background images, I attached them on the containers of relevant images/texts and posisitoned them.
By using <button> for arrows to control sliders, they are keybord focusable and controllable.
All contents are toggled by pressing prev/next arrow buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Dart Sass

### What I learned

### Continued development

- Slider effect for JavaScript. I would like to know what is the best solution for these type of slide which are sets of image and the description.
